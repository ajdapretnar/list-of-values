# Lists of values
List of values derived from the REIMAGINE ADM project.
Both version 1 and 2 were derived via ChatGPT, then refined and adjusted by twelve social science and humanities researchers. Version 1 includes 67 values, while version 2 includes 82. Note that direct mapping between translations is extremely difficult and this is an approximation. Typically, these lists would be used to extract lists of values in the native language, then map them to English.

We accept suggestions and contributions for eventual version 3.
